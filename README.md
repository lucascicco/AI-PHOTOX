# Aiphotox

This mobile application was developed on Flutter using Tensor Flow Lite **tflite** as the main library to work with Artificial Intelligence, so the **image_picker** was used to grab the pictures from camera and albuns, the **mobx** and **flutter_modular** both were used to structure to state management and dependency injection, also the **translator** was used to translate based on GOOGLE API some texts inside of the app. Some animations were used too, like: **AnimatedContainer**, **animated_text_kit**, etc...
